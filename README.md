## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve jobs-listing`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!

## Functionality overview

The application is an example of a job listing app.


**General functionality:**

- Authenticate users via Firebase (login/signup pages + logout button on navbar component)
- GET and display paginated list of jobs (mock data used)
- UserProfile Page (2 Roles Job Posters/Seekers)
- Job posters can do CRUD Operations Job Listings
- Job seekers favorite jobs
### Architecture

#### Folders/Libs structure
For this project I have created a monorepo. 
There is one app for the moment (jobs-listing-portal) which consumes the libraries under the libs folder.

The folder structure is:
~~~
├── libs
│   ├── jobs
│   │   ├── data-access
│   │   ├── feature-job-details
│   │   ├── feature-jobs-list
│   ├── auth
│   │   ├── data-access
│   │   ├── feature-auth
│   ├── core
│   │   ├── forms
│   ├── profile
│   │   ├── data-access
│   │   ├── feature-profile
│   ├── ui
│   │   ├── components
~~~

I used two classifiers to name the libraries. 
The first classifier is the `scope` and the second the `type`.

The `scope` is the section (domain) of the app the library can be used.
It gives a clear indication that a feature belongs to a specific domain. 
For example the libraries under `profile` scope, are used in the profile and favourite profile pages.

The `type` indicates the purpose of a library. 
- `Feature` contains smart components.
- `UI` contains dumb components.
- `Data Access` contains entities, logic, services, state management.
- `Util` contains helper functions. TBD


#### State management
**TBD**

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/core-features/distribute-task-execution)
